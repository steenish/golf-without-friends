# Golf Without Friends

This is a project completed as a group of two people for the project part of the course DD1354 Models and simulation at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, KTH.

The project is a simulation of a golf course where the collision detection and response, along with all other physics simulation, were implemented by us. Unity is used to render the simulation.

### Controls

The simulation has the following controls:

- A and D or Left arrow and Right arrow: Rotate the camera around the golf ball.
- Left click: Use putter on golf ball in the direction that the camera is facing.
- Middle click: Use drive on golf ball in the direction that the camera is facing.
- Right click: Use wedge on golf ball in the direction that the camera is facing.
- Esc: Restart simulation.
